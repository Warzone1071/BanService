## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

- **put code inside a module script inside ServerScriptService**

- **make a folder named "Libs" inside the module script**

- get the WebhookService module from luascapes discord server **https://discord.gg/hzxbz89MGW**

- **put the module inside the libs folder and name it "WebhookService"**

- **create a module script inside "BanService" module and name it "BanDataTemplate" put the BanDataTemplate Default data table code inside it**

- **Now lastly just require the module thats how you get the module to run look below for the example scripts**

The service automatically handles saving/loading on player join/leave.


## Example Scripts

**Script to run BanService and setup the webhook**

```lua
local BanService = require(Path.To.Module) -- put the module in ServerScriptService -- this is all you need to set it up

BanService:CreateWebhook("WEBHOOK_URL") -- Optional this is just to create the webhook
```

**Example BanDataTemplate | Note it should be a module script that is a child of BanService named "BanDataTemplate"**

```lua
return {
	IsBanned = false,
	Reason = "",
	Duration = 0,
	BanTime = 0, 
	BannedBy = 0,
}

-- Note if u change the data here and you want to change something with how they ban or remove something you will have to change the banservice functions slightly
